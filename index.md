## What's so super about it? It's actually the title of a translated Chinese web novel with over 3400+ chapter. The actual characters translate into, <u>Super God Gene</u>, so it's already about as unflashy as it's going to get. Except for the the GIF of the black gem I made. My ADHD thought of it and wouldn't let it go. So suffer along with me.
